# Giving credit where credit is due

Many of these utils are copy/pasted from open-source projects from around the web. We will attribute functions to their creators (it's on our list of things to do) and we hope function authors understand that we're not trying to take credit for their work. We don't want credit, we just want a collection of great open-source utils supported by the community.
If you include your own code in the library, please be sure to add a credit for yourself in the comments or use an @author tag in the asDocs.
